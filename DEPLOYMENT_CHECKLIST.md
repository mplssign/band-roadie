‚úì NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY set
```

### Production

```bash
[ ] NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL set in Vercel
[ ] NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY set in Vercel
[ ] NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL set to production domain
```

### Supabase Dashboard

```bash
[ ] Site URL configured: https://your-domain.com
[ ] Redirect URL added: https://your-domain.com/auth/callback

```

## Testing Before Deploy

### Local Testing

- [ ] Request magic link
- [ ] Click link in same browser ‚Üí should work
- [ ] Open link in different browser ‚Üí should show clear error
- [ ] Test expired link ‚Üí should show expired message
- [ ] Check console logs ‚Üí should see diagnostic info
- [ ] Check debug panel ‚Üí should appear in dev mode

### Preview Deployment

```bash
[ ] Deploy to preview branch
[ ] Test magic link flow on preview URL
[ ] Test from real email client
[ ] Test on mobile device
[ ] Verify redirect URLs work correctly
```

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Commit Changes

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "fix(auth): comprehensive magic link authentication fix

- Add support for both PKCE and legacy token_hash formats
- Detect and handle browser context mismatch
- Prevent service worker from caching auth routes
- Enhance error messaging and user feedback
- Add diagnostic logging for debugging

Fixes: 400 error when clicking magic links
Closes: #[issue-number]"
```

### 2. Push to Preview

```bash
git push origin feature/magic-link-fix
# Wait for Vercel preview deployment
# Test thoroughly on preview URL
```

### 3. Merge to Main

```bash
git checkout main
git merge feature/magic-link-fix
git push origin main
```

### 4. Monitor Deployment

```bash
[ ] Vercel build succeeds
[ ] No build errors
[ ] No runtime errors
```

## Post-Deployment Verification

### Immediate Checks (0-5 minutes)

- [ ] Production site loads
- [ ] Login page accessible
- [ ] Request magic link works
- [ ] Magic link email received
- [ ] Click link ‚Üí successful authentication
- [ ] No console errors

### Short-term Monitoring (1-24 hours)

- [ ] No 400 errors in Supabase logs
- [ ] No increase in auth errors
- [ ] Users successfully authenticating
- [ ] No reports of stuck auth flows

### Service Worker Cache

```bash
[ ] Existing users: May need to clear cache (see CLEAR_PWA_CACHE.md)
[ ] New users: Fresh service worker, no issues
```

## Rollback Plan

### If Critical Issues Occur

1. **Immediate Rollback**

   ```bash
   git revert HEAD
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Alternative: Deploy Previous Version**

   ```bash
   # In Vercel dashboard
   - Go to Deployments
   - Find previous working deployment
   - Click "..." ‚Üí Promote to Production
   ```

3. **Notify Users**
   - Post status update
   - Explain temporary login issues
   - Provide timeline for fix

## Success Criteria

### Must Have (P0)

- ‚úì Works in all major email clients
- ‚úì Clear error messages when issues occur

### Should Have (P1)

- ‚úì Browser mismatch detection works
- ‚úì Service worker not caching auth routes
- ‚úì Diagnostic logs in development
- ‚úì Graceful error handling

### Nice to Have (P2)

- ‚úì Debug panel for developers

## Communication Plan

### Internal Team

```
‚úÖ Magic link auth fix deployed to production

Changes:
- Fixed 400 error when clicking magic links
- Added support for opening links in different browsers
- Enhanced error messages
- Service worker no longer caches auth routes

Testing: Thoroughly tested in dev and preview
Risk: Low - backwards compatible with enhanced error handling
Rollback: Simple git revert if needed

Please test your own login flow and report any issues.
```

### Users (if needed)

```
We've improved our login system! You may notice:
- Clearer error messages if something goes wrong
- Better handling of login links
- Faster, more reliable authentication

If you experience any login issues, please request a new login link.
```

## Known Issues & Workarounds

### Issue: Old service worker cached

**Workaround**: Users clear cache or wait for automatic update (24-48 hours)

### Issue: Link opened in different browser

**Expected**: Clear error message tells user to open in same browser

### Issue: Expired link

**Expected**: Clear message to request new link

## Monitoring & Alerts

### Metrics to Watch

- [ ] Auth success rate (should not decrease)
- [ ] 400 error rate (should go to ~0)
- [ ] Login completion time (should not increase)
- [ ] User complaints about login (should decrease)

### Logs to Monitor

```bash
# Vercel logs - watch for:
- "[Auth Callback] PKCE exchange error"
- "[Auth Callback] Token hash verification error"
- "browser_mismatch"
- "otp_expired"
```
